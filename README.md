# pipeline_with_spark

Built machine learning pipelines using Python and Spark, free, open-source programs that can be downloaded. 

Loaded dataset in Spark and performed basic cleaning techniques such as removing columns with high missing values and removing rows with missing values. 

Built a machine learning pipeline with a random forest regression model. Used cross validation and parameter tuning to select the best model from the pipeline. 

Lastly, evaluated modelâ€™s performance using various metrics. A pipeline in Spark combines multiple execution steps in the order of their execution. 

So rather than executing the steps individually, one can put them in a pipeline to streamline the machine learning process. 

This pipeline can be saved and shared it with others, and load it back again.
